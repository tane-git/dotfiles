Made install_zsh.sh script

`chmod +x install_zsh.sh`
`./install_zsh.sh`

Then ran, installing zsh and setting it as default. Restarting for this to take effect, however maybe not necessary?

Made install_ohmyzsh.sh

`chmod +x install_ohmyzsh.sh`
`./install_ohmyzsh.sh`

Made install_nvim.sh

`chmod +x install_nvim.sh`
`./install_nvim.sh`

Now NVIM worked

Tried working on dotfiles repo, setting up setup.sh but ran into issue with gh not being setup

Made install_gh.sh

`chmod +x install_gh.sh`
`./install_gh.sh`

Had to manually go to browser and register device (it made keys yay)

Then had to add:

`gh auth setup-git`

To install_gh.sh as this finalized the thing and let me `ggp`

Now we need to try get dotfiles again...

`chmod +x clone_dotfiles.sh`
`./clone_dotfiles.sh`

Added stuff to the ~/dotfiles/setup.sh to get .zshrc and .aliases.zsh.

Made tane-git/nvim a submodule of dotfiles, and added it to setup.sh.

Now need to ensure nvim is default git editor. Can't have nano open again.
